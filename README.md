Conway's game of life with an additional rule, allowing for it to traverse the 2-dimensional surface of the N-dimensional hypercube. Work in progress! There aren't many features.

Note: this program can currently only display N=3, N=4, and N=5, but the algorithm scales to arbitrary N. Work in progress!
